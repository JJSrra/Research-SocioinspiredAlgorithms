# Research-SocioinspiredAlgorithms

### By Juanjo Sierra

Research and statistic study on some Socioinspired Algorithms for my bachelor's thesis.

I will be uploading source code from each one of them as I implement it. At the end, there will be 8 algorithms:
- Soccer League Competition (SLC)
- League Championship Algorithm (LCA)
- Ideology Algorithm (IA)
- Anarchic Society Optimization (ASO)
- Parliamentary Political Competitions (POA)
- Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA)
- Social Emotional Optimization Algorithm (SEA)
- Society And Civilization: Simulation Of Social Behaviour

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the different algorithms through results and statistics, using data and functions from some competitions, and analyze the results obtained by socioinspired algorithms in comparison with other reference algorithms.
