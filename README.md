# Research-SocioinspiredAlgorithms

### By Juanjo Sierra

Research and statistic study on some Socioinspired Algorithms for my bachelor's thesis.

I will be uploading source code from each one of them as I implement them. At the end, there will be 6 algorithms:
- Soccer League Competition (SLC)
- [Ideology Algorithm (IA)](https://github.com/JJSrra/IdeologyAlgorithm)
- Anarchic Society Optimization (ASO)
- Parliamentary Political Competitions (POA)
- Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA)
- Social Emotional Optimization Algorithm (SEA)

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the different algorithms through results and statistics, using data and functions from some competitions, and analyze the results obtained by socioinspired algorithms in comparison with other reference algorithms.
